# Vertical Search Engine
This independent project involved the development of a vertical search engine for Coventry University's School of Economics, Finance, and Accounting. The project utilized a web scraper to extract data from the university's website.

After extracting the data, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was performed to transform the data into JSON format. The transformed data was then loaded into Azure Blob storage, ensuring secure and reliable storage for future use by the search engine.

To enable efficient scaling and automation of the data extraction process, the web scraper was deployed on Azure Function. This cloud-based service provided the necessary scalability and cost optimization for handling increased workload and user traffic.

Using technologies such as Beautiful Soup and Flask, the project implemented web scraping, inverted index, and query processing functionalities. The resulting web application, deployed on Azure cloud as a Web App, offered seamless availability and scalability to users.

In summary, this project developed a specialized search engine for Coventry University's School of Economics, Finance, and Accounting. By leveraging a web scraper to extract data, performing ETL transformations, and utilizing Azure cloud services, the search engine provided accurate results and secure data storage.
